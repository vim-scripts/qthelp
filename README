This plugin would allow you to open Qt help pages in browser from your C++ source code. Currently it can show help if the word underneath your cursor is a class name, a variable name or a class-member name.

Examples:

QStr|ing trackTitle, artistName;
QString track|Title, artistName(\"Unknown\");
track|Title = \"Unknown\";
Running command :QHelpOnThis will open help on QString.

trackTitle.ri|ght(10);
Running command :QHelpOnThis will open help on QString::right.

Running command :QHelp QPixmap::QPixmap will open help on
QPixmap constructor.

Configuring:

g:qthelp_browser - command to run your browser
default: &#039&#039 (so an error message will be printed if your try to use plugin)
Note: on Windows use something like (notice &#039start&#039 at the beginning)
&#039start c:\\Program files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe&#039
or Vim will be waiting until you close your browser.

Using:

1. Make tags-file for your html-qthelp.
2. Add that tags-file into your &#039tags&#039 option (WARNING: doing this in your .vimrc file can slow down and pollute completion list for not Qt-projects).
3. Setup g:qthelp_browser variable with the command to run your browser.
4. Map command QHelpOnThis on some hotkey.
5. Use QHelp from command-line for faster navigating through help (to escape manual searching of needed section).

Limitation:

I didn&#039t found a way to determine inheritance hierarchy using tags so trying
QStringList strlst;
strlst.in|sert(\"String\");
will open reference for QString, not for QList::insert.

Warning:

In some cases it can take a while for searching definition (for example when it doesn&#039t exist) if this happens hit Ctrl-C to break searching.

Advice:

You may be interesting in inccomplete (vimscript #3345) plugin, that can help to find header file you need.
